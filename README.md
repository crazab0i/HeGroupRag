I will populate some demos on RAG and LLMs when I get them working.
  Python 3.11.9 was used.

Priority task: Do more research about RAG and hopefully get a knowledge graph model/demo working.

LangChain Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch

I will update the ai papers pdf.
