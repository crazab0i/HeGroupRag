Immunization Route: Footpad Injection Host Response Mouse Response Host Strain: Balb/c, C57BL/6 and C3H Vaccination Protocol: The immunization doses and boosters of each antigen were the following: Rop2 (44 kDa, 2 &mu;g), LiHsp83 (86 kDa, 6 &mu;g), Rop2-LiHsp83 (not, vert, similar120 kDa, 9 &mu;g) and the mixture of Rop2 and LiHsp83 (2 + 6 &mu;g, respectively). Balb/c, C57BL/6 and C3H mice were immunized by footpad injections on days 0, 21, 35 and 45 with PBS (control) or recombinant proteins (Echeverria et al., 2006). Challenge Protocol: To analyze protection against virulent T. gondii strain (lethal challenge) immunized mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 105 T. gondii RH tachyzoites 2 weeks after the last immunization. To analyze protection against non-lethal challenge, immunized mice were orally infected with 20 cysts of the ME49 T. gondii strain 2 weeks after the last booster. The brain parasite load was evaluated 1 month after infection (Echeverria et al., 2006). Efficacy: Vaccination with fusion protein conferred a remarkable resistance against oral infection with ME49 cysts in C57BL/6 and C3H mice, in comparison to mice immunized with Rop2 alone or the protein mixture. Following lethal challenge, a significant survival rate was observed in Rop2-83 immunized Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice in comparison to control groups (Echeverria et al., 2006).
