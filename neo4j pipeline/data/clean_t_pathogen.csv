146,Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV),10995,Infectious Bursal Disease,8,virus,,,,"The virus is attracted to lymphoid cells and especially those of B-lyphocyte origins. Young birds at around two to eight weeks of age that have highly active bursa of Fabricius are more susceptible to disease. Birds over eight weeks are resistant to challenge and will not show clinical signs unless infected by highly virulent strains.
After ingestion, the virus destroys the lymphoid follicles in the bursa of Fabricius as well as the circulating B-cells in the secondary lymphoid tissues such as GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue), CALT (conjunctiva), BALT (Bronchial) cecal tonsils, Harderian gland, etc. Acute disease and death is due to the necrotizing effect of these viruses on the host tissue. If the bird survives and recovers from this phase of the disease, they remain immunocompromised which means they are more susceptible to other diseases and vaccination in the face of outbreak will not be effective [Ref1570:Wiki: Infectious Bursal Disease].","Passive immunity protects against disease, as does previous infection with avirulent strains. In broiler farms, breeder flocks are immunized against IBD so that they would confer protective antibodies to their progenies which would be slaughtered for consumption before their passive immunity wears out [Ref1570:Wiki: Infectious Bursal Disease].",
150,Chicken Anemia Virus,12618,"Chicken infectious anemia, Blue wing disease, Anemia dermatitis syndrome, Hemorrhagic aplastic anemi",8,virus,,,,"The principal sites of CAV replication are hemocytoblasts in the bone marrow, precursor T cells in the cortex of the thymus, and CD8 cells in the spleen. Replication in the first leads to anemia, while replication in the latter two causes immunosuppression. Neutralizing antibodies are detectable 21 days after infection and clinical, hematologic, and pathologic parameters return to normal ~35 days after infection. CAV infection has adverse effects on proliferative responses of spleen lymphocytes and on the production of interleukin-2 and interferons by splenocytes. Infection can cause a marked decrease in generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells directed against other pathogens. In addition to T-cell defects, macrophage functions such as Fc-receptor expression, phagocytosis, and antimicrobial activity may be impaired. Subclinical, horizontally acquired infection with CAV in broiler progeny of seropositive parent flocks may be associated with impaired economic performance [Ref1575:Merck Vet Manual: Chicken Anemia Virus Infection].",,
43,Shigella,620,Shigellosis,2,G- bacterium,VO_0012208,,VO_0010777,"Infection is generally limited to the intestinal mucosa and involves a possible enterotoxic or cytoxic diarrhoeal prodrome, cytokine-mediated inflammation of the colon, and necrosis of the colonic epithelium. This inflammation is caused by the invasion of Shigella into the colonic epithelium and the lamina propria. Shigella can enter both M cells and enterocytes, reorganizing the cytoskeleton, beginning with the type II secretion system. The colitis and ulceration of the mucosa result in febrile diarrhoea and/or bloody, mucoid stools [Ref648:Niyogi, 2005].

Shigella strains produce three distinct enterotoxins: 
(i) chromosome encoded shigella enterotoxin 1 (SHET1) which is present in all S. flexneri 2a but rarely found in other shigella serotypes. This toxin is enterotoxic, neurotoxic, and cytoxic, with a structure simlilar to the Shiga-like toxins of enterohaemorrhagic E. Coli infection. The toxin is not essential for virulence, but does contribute  to the severity of disease manifestations. Also, this toxin adheres to the small intestine receptors and blocks electrolyte, glucose, and amino acid absorption from the intestinal lumen. The B subunit of this toxin binds host cell glycolipid in the large intestine, A1 domain internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and  causes irreversible inactivation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis, causing cell death, microvasculature damage to the intestine, and haemorrhage.  
(ii) shigella enterotoxin 2 (SHET2), which is located on a large plasmid associated with the virulence of shigella. SHET2 was found in many shigella of different serotypes and also in enteroinvasive E. coli.  
Inactivation of SHET1 and SHET2 through genetic engineering is used for attenuation of new shigella vaccine candidates.
(iii) phage-born Shiga toxin by S. dysenteriae [Ref648:Niyogi, 2005].

","Wild type Shigella infection induces protective immunity, which develops after repeated exposure during childhood. This immunity is serotype specific (e.g., directed to the LPS O antigen of this organism). Shigella antigen specific antibody response develops early in infection and follows the typical course for anti-LPS antibodies, that is, an IgM response that peaks within weeks of exposure and wanes after 1-2 year [Ref648:Niyogi, 2005].",-
140,Streptococcus pyogenes,1314,"Group A streptococcal infections, Strep throat, Scarlet fever",2,G+ bacterium,,,VO_0012357,Colonization of tissues by S. pyogenes is thought to result from a failure in the constitutive defenses (normal flora and other nonspecific defense mechanisms) which allows establishment of the bacterium at a portal of entry (often the upper respiratory tract or the skin) where the organism multiplies and causes an inflammatory purulent lesion [Ref1526:Textbook of Bacteriology].,Macrophages and the antibody mediated response are the major defenses for host protective immunity against S. pyogenes infection [Ref1526:Textbook of Bacteriology].,
46,Neisseria meningitidis,487,Meningitis,2,G- bacterium,VO_0012202,,VO_0010778,"Meningococcus is spread through the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions during activities like coughing, kissing, and chewing on toys. Those with impaired immunity may be easier to get meningococcus. Meningococcal virulence is related to both capsule expression, expression of other surface structures, and underlying genotype. N meningitidis pathogenesis is related to its ability to express and modify capsule with serogroups A, B, C, W-135, X, and Y. Capsules of N meningitidis facilitate transmission and colonisation, and protect the meningococcus from desiccation, phagocytic killing, opsonisation, and complement-mediated bactericidal killing. Outer membrane proteins (e.g., PorB, PorA , Opa and Opc) contribute to meningococcal virulence. Outer membrane porins are involved in host-cell interactions and as targets for bactericidal antibodies. Endotoxin, or lipo-oligosaccharide, a major component of the outer membrane, differs in structure from enteric endotoxins and is crucial in inflammatory signalling via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [Ref713:Stephens et al., 2007].","N. mengingitidis establishes systemic infections only in individuals who lack serum bacterial antibodies directed against the capsular or noncapsular (cell wall) antigens of the invading strain, or in patients deficient in the late-acting complement components. The presence of serum bactericidal IgG and IgM is probably the most important host factor in preventing invasive disease. The role of bactericidal antibodies in prevention of invasive disease explains why high attack rates are seen in infants from 6 to 9 months old, the time at which maternal antibodies are being lost. Individuals with complement deficiencies (C5, C6, C7, or C8) may develop meningococcemia despite protective antibody. This emphasizes the importance of the complement system in defense against meningococcal disease [Ref1544:Textbook of Bacteriology].",-
49,Hepatitis B virus,10407,Hepatitis B,"42,2",virus,VO_0012223,,VO_0010781,"HBV primarily interferes with the functions of the liver by replicating in hepatocytes. HBV virions bind to the host cell via the preS domain of the viral surface antigen, leading to subsequent internalization through endocytosis. HBV-preS specific receptors are primarily expressed on hepatocytes. During HBV infection, the host immune response causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance. The innate immune response does not play a significant role in these processes. The adaptive immune response, particularly virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection. Liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs. Antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology [Ref718:Wiki: Hepatitis B].","During HBV infection, the host immune response causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance. Although the innate immune response does not play a significant role in these processes, the adaptive immune response, particularly virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection. By killing infected cells and by producing antiviral cytokines capable of purging HBV from viable hepatocytes, CTLs eliminate the virus. Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and platelets activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver [Ref718:Wiki: Hepatitis B].",n
53,Mumps virus,11161,Mumps,2,virus,VO_0012235,,VO_0010785,"Mumps is acquired through inoculation and replication of the virus in the nasal or upper-respiratory-tract mucosa. Infection can remain localised to the respiratory tract.12 Transient plasma viraemia is probably frequent, occurs late in the incubation period, and leads to viral spread into organs. Infected mononuclear cells can also contribute to systemic viral spread.The parotids are the most commonly affected organs, but parotitis is not a primary or necessary step for mumps infection. The central nervous system (CNS), urinary tract, and genital organs can also be affected. Infection of the kidneys leads to viruria, which is present in most patients and lasts for 10â€“14 days. Plasma viremia seems to be restricted by the humoral immune response,16 and salivary secretion of the virus correlates inversely with the local production of virus-specific secretory IgA [Ref726:Hviid et al., 2008].","Mumps as an illness is generally benign and self-resolving. Titres of neutralising antibody are related to clinical protection, but there is no surrogate immunological marker for protection [Ref726:Hviid et al., 2008].",n
58,Rubella virus,11041,Rubella,2,virus,VO_0012244,,VO_0010790,Rubella virus is transmitted by the respiratory route and replicates in the nasopharynx and lymph nodes. The virus is found in the blood 5 to 7 days after infection and spreads throughout the body. It is capable of crossing the placenta and infecting the fetus where it stops cells from developing or destroys them [Ref741:Wiki: Rebella].,,n
18,Variola virus,10255,Smallpox,2,virus,VO_0012200,,VO_0010764,"Smallpox is a viral disease unique to humans. To sustain itself, the virus must pass from person to person in a continuing chain of infection and is spread by inhalation of air droplets or aerosols. There are three principal routes of viral infection corresponding to the three principal surfaces of the body: the respiratory tract, the alimentary tract, and the skin. Minor routes of infection include the urinary and genital tracts and the conjunctiva. Although congenital infection occasionally occurred in smallpox, it was of no epidemiologic importance. The infectious dose is unknown but is believed to be only a few virions [Ref150:Henderson, 1999].
It is assumed to be low, 10 to 100 organisms [Ref151:Franz et al., 1997]. 
Variola is most effectively spread via the respiratory route with as little as ten plaque-forming units contained within aerosolized saliva able to transmit the infection from person to person [Ref152:Hassett, 2003].
Variola virus is highly stable and retains its infectivity for long periods outside the host. It is infectious by aerosol, but natural airborne spread to other than close contacts is controversial. Approximately 30% of susceptible contacts became infected during the era of endemic smallpox, and the WHO eradication campaign was predicated on close person-to-person proximity being required for transmission to occur reliably. Nevertheless, variola virus's potential in low relative humidity for airborne dissemination was alarming in two hospital outbreaks. On natural exposure to aerosolized virus, variola travels from the upper or the lower respiratory tract to regional lymph nodes, where it replicates and gives rise to viremia, which is followed soon thereafter by a rash [Ref134:PathPort].","Both cellular and humoral immune response are important in protection against smallpox. In mouse models of vaccinia infection, extensive studies have shown that passive immunotherapy with immune serum or monoclonal antibodies are protective. Antiviral antibody could protect mice efficiently even if CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were depleted prior to challenge. However, in B-cell-deficient or MHC II-deficient mice, which are unable to elicit effective antibody responses, strong antiviral T-cell responses played an important role in protecting against disease following viral challenge. Studies using non-human primates infected with lethal monkeypox showed that the smallpox vaccine-induced antibody responses were both necessary and sufficient for protection against lethal monkeypox infection. In humans, cellular immunity played the most important role in protective immunity in humans against  primary poxvirus infections based on the severe complications following smallpox vaccination of children with genetic T-cell deficiencies. Following vaccination, strong antiviral antibody responses are likely to be the main effector mechanism responsible for protection against secondary infection [Ref182:Amanna et al., 2006]. ",n
31,Haemophilus influenzae,727,Meningitis,2,G- bacterium,VO_0012204,,VO_0010772,"The most important virulence factor defining pathogenic H. influenzae strains is capsule, of which six serotypes, a-f, have been described. Among encapsulated strains, those possessing the type b capsule (Hib strains), which is composed of polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP), are the most virulent, capable of causing sustained bacteremia and subsequent focal infection in non-immune, normal hosts. Like the capsules of other gram negative organisms, H. influenzae capsules enhance the pathogenicity of the bacteria by protecting them from phagocytosis. The strong negative charge of the polysaccharide capsules may provide electrostatic repulsion to phagocytic cells and the capsular material itself may sterically interfere with the binding of opsonizing antibodies and complement to the bacterial surface [Ref253:Marrs et al., 2001].

H. influenzae pili (sometimes called fimbriae) was the first well studied adherence factors of H. influenzae. These filamentous organelles are seen by electron microscopy distributed in a peritrichous manner on the H. influenzae bacterial cell surface of isolates that hemagglutinate and adhere to buccal epithelial cells, but are absent from non-hemagglutinating and non-adherent bacteria. Generally strains isolated from invasive infections do not express pili, while those colonizing the nasopharynx more commonly do. piliated H. influenzae binds to erythrocytes possessing the Anton (AnWj) antigen. Additional studies have shown that sialic acid-containing lactosylceramides, the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3 and GD1a, inhibit pilus- mediated H. influenzae binding to both buccal epithelial cells and erythrocytes [Ref253:Marrs et al., 2001].

Highly similar high-molecular-weight proteins (HMW1, HMW2) were first identified as H. influenzae-associated antigens by their ability to induce robust antibody responses in individuals with acute otitis media . Subsequent studies have revealed that these HMW proteins function as adherence factors and can facilitate the colonization of cultured human epithelial cells . HMW1 is a 160 kDa product of the hmw1A gene and HMW2 is a 155 kDa protein encoded by the hmw2A gene; hmw1A and hmw2A are 71% identical and 80% similar . To date the hmw genes have only been detected in nontypable strains, and a majority of HMW-positive strains retain both chromosomal loci [Ref253:Marrs et al., 2001]. 

Secretory IgA fulfills many protective functions on the mucosal surface; these include the neutralization of toxins, inhibition of pathogen attachment to the epithelium, and agglutination of organisms within mucus . To surmount this immunological obstacle, H. influenzae constitutively secrete IgA1 proteases which are enzymes that inactivate the predominant IgA species, IgA1, by cleaving the immunoglobulin molecule at the heavy chain hinge region, resulting in the production of two fragments (Fab and Fc). [Ref256:Reinholdt et al., 1997]

H. influenzae produces a lipopolysaccharide structure that lacks an O-specific antigen and, instead, incorporates short oligosaccharide side chains onto three conserved heptoses and is thus termed lipooligosaccharide (LOS). A wide variety of glyco-modifications to the core LOS molecule have been detected and include the addition of glucose, galactose, lactose, phosphatidylcholine (ChoP), and sialic acid. This repertoire of sugars allows the organism to mimic common eukaryotic glycolipid structures, and is presumably an adaptive strategy for subverting immune defenses [Ref253:Marrs et al., 2001].","Newborns are protected by transplacental maternal type b antibodies and older children and adults are protected by ""natural antibodies"", which are H. influenzae specific antibodies in a host who has not had a known H. influenzae infection. Most likely these antibodies result from subclinical infection or asymptomatic colonization [Ref255:Talan et al., 1999].",-
52,Measles virus,11234,Measles,2,virus,VO_0012234,,VO_0010784,"Measles virus (MV) has two envelope glycoproteins, the haemagglutinin (H) and fusion proteins, which are responsible for attachment and membrane fusion, respectively. Human signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM; also called CD150), a membrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, acts as a cellular receptor for MV. SLAM is expressed on immature thymocytes, activated lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. It regulates production of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 by CD4+ T cells, as well as production of IL-12, tumour necrosis factor alpha and nitric oxide by macrophages. The distribution of SLAM is in accord with the lymphotropism and immunosuppressive nature of MV [Ref724:Yanagi et al., 2006].","Although innate responses probably contribute to control of virus replication during the incubation period, the onset of clinically apparent disease coincides with the appearance of MV-specific adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses. Antibody can protect from MV infection and may contribute to recovery from infection. Antibody is sufficient for protection because infants are protected by maternal antibody and passive transfer of immune serum can modify or interfere with measles vaccination and can partially protect children from measles after exposure. The best correlate of protection from infection is the level of neutralizing antibody. In infants, the level of maternal antibody correlates with failure of the humoral response to vaccination [Ref723:Griffin et al., 2008].",n

Mutations have been identified in non-structural genes, and more may remain to be identified. These highly virulent FPIV mutants have consistently induced FIP under experimental conditions, but their virulence has not been traced to a molecular source. The viral load and the catâ€™s immune response determine whether FIP will develop. Both viral genetics and host immunity are likely to play a role in the development of FIP. The pathology of FIP has been classified into two forms: an effusive (wet) FIP characterised by polyserositis (eg, thoracic and abdominal effusion)and vasculitis, and a non-effusive (dry) FIP characterised by granulomatous lesions in organs [Ref1608:Addie et al., 2009].","It has been suggested that cats mounting a strong cell-mediated immune response do not develop FIP, whereas cats showing a predominantly humoral response progress to disease.

In contrast, development of neutralising antibodies (NAs) is delayed and generation of cell-mediated immune responses, such as PRRSV-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma secreting cells, is initially erratic. In spite of this, induction of strong and rapid NAs and IFN-gamma responses seem to be required for effective vaccination. PRRSV strongly modulates the host's immune responses.
